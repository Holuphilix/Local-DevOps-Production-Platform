# Local DevOps Production Platform

## 1. Project Overview

This project simulates a production-grade payment processing backend system built using modern DevOps practices. The platform is designed to run entirely in a local environment while reflecting real-world production architecture patterns.

The system includes:

- A Spring Boot payment processing API
- PostgreSQL database for persistence
- Containerization using Docker
- Multi-container orchestration using Docker Compose
- Kubernetes deployment using Kind
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions
- Security scanning with Trivy
- Monitoring and observability using Prometheus and Grafana

The objective of this project is to simulate production-level DevOps workflows, system design practices, and infrastructure management in a controlled local environment.
